Software Development Lifecycle 

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

-Having meetings with clients and discussing their needs and wants for their producit is essential to the development of the software. Using agile methodology allows the cient to stay involved in making decisions and keeping them involved in the progress of the product. By having meetings with the client, I can interpret user needs and ensure they are implemented into the program by drawing up a plan and breaking up the development by teams. These teams utilize these development plans, or user stories, to stay on track with the deadline. Daily meetings are held to follow up oin the progress on the user stories and determine what needs to be done in order to complete them. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

-When approaching developiong a program, after have already met with the client, it is best to ensure that I understand the outcome and end goals of the product. To do so, I will ask questions about the program, what it entails, and any other details that could potentially cause delay to the release of the project. Some agile process to incorporate into the development would be Scrum events such as Scrum meetings, breaking up the workloads into user stories, and dispersing these user stories amongst teams. Some other agile processes would be utilizing tools such as VersionOne to keep the teams all on one page and in constant communication. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

-When there is a team, that means there is an end goal to be completed by more than one person. To do so, one must come prepared and ready to do their part. A good team member ensures their goals are met every day as well as offering help when they are able to. A team comes together and each member is held accountable for their own actions and they take responsibility and ownership in their tasks.
